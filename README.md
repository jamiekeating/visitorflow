# Visitorflow

A fork of [IMAmuseum/visitorflow](https://github.com/IMAmuseum/visitorflow) which aims to separate the roles of the client and the server into separate components and provide a simple deploy method of the server using Docker.

## Components
There are currently two components in the system

* Client - To be installed on a Raspberry Pi.
* Server - To be connected to by the Raspberry Pi clients and to be queried by the end user.
